# Gemini Deep Research Skill

Run autonomous research tasks that plan, search, read, and synthesize information into comprehensive reports.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Performing market analysis
- Conducting competitive landscaping
- Creating literature reviews
- Doing technical research
- Performing due diligence
- Need detailed, cited research reports

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- httpx: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable

## Setup

1. Get a Gemini API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/)
2. Set the environment variable:
   ```bash
   export GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```
   Or create a `.env` file in the skill directory.

## Usage

### Start a research task
```bash
python scripts/research.py --query "Research the history of Kubernetes"
```

### With structured output format
```bash
python scripts/research.py --query "Compare Python web frameworks" \
  --format "1. Executive Summary\n2. Comparison Table\n3. Recommendations"
```

### Stream progress in real-time
```bash
python scripts/research.py --query "Analyze EV battery market" --stream
```

### Check status of running research
```bash
python scripts/research.py --status <interaction_id>
```

### Continue from previous research
```bash
python scripts/research.py --query "Elaborate on point 2" --continue <interaction_id>
```

## Best Use Cases

- Market analysis and competitive landscaping
- Technical literature reviews
- Due diligence research
- Historical research and timelines
- Comparative analysis (frameworks, products, technologies)

## Workflow

1. User requests research → Run `--query "..."`
2. Inform user of estimated time (2-10 minutes)
3. Monitor with `--stream` or poll with `--status`
4. Return formatted results
5. Use `--continue` for follow-up questions
